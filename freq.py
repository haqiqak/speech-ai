"""
freq.py — single choke-point for word-frequency lookups.

Why this exists: wordfreq's default ("best") loads the *large* English wordlist,
a multi-hundred-MB in-memory dict.  On RAM-constrained machines building it
raises MemoryError, which would otherwise crash the whole synonym pipeline
(engine ranking, semantic scoring, phonetic difficulty all call it).

Behaviour:
  • Default wordlist = "best" (== large when present) → identical numbers to the
    original code when there is enough RAM, so synonym quality is preserved.
  • On MemoryError it transparently and permanently downshifts to the small
    wordlist (a few MB) and keeps running.  For common words small == large.
  • Override the preference explicitly with the WORDFREQ_LIST env var
    (e.g. set WORDFREQ_LIST=small to force low-memory mode from the start).

Public API mirrors wordfreq.zipf_frequency(word, lang) so callers only swap the
import, not the call sites.
